\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding spacetime as an emergent phenomenon arising from quantum statistical processes, rather than as a given background. We propose three fundamental bases that underpin this emergence and outline the key principles governing the transition from quantum to classical spacetime.
\end{abstract}

\section{Core of the Theory: Fundamental Proposition and ``Three Bases''}

The fundamental proposition of this theory remains unchanged: \textbf{spacetime is not a given background but emerges from the statistical aggregation of quantum states}. However, we refine the core concepts supporting this emergence by focusing on \textbf{more rigorous physical bases}, redefining them as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\pi$ (Geometry and Symmetry)}: A universal mathematical constant that defines geometric structures and spatial dimensions.
    \item \textbf{$e$ (Statistical Scaling)}: A mathematical constant governing the principle by which probabilistic fluctuations are suppressed and stable classical behavior emerges when multiple degrees of freedom cooperate.
    \item \textbf{$\hbar$ (Quantum Granularity)}: The minimum unit of action, serving as a physical anchor for the emergence of classical behavior.
\end{itemize}

These three bases symbolize different physical aspects (geometry, statistics, and quantum nature) and serve as the fundamental driving forces of spacetime emergence.

\section{Three Major Principles of Emergence and ``$\varphi$ as a Guarantor''}

\subsection{Quantum Statistical Scaling Principle ($e, \hbar$)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Fluctuations (variances) in time and space are suppressed inversely proportional to the \textbf{number of effective quantum degrees of freedom ($N_q$)}.
    $$\mathrm{Var} \propto \frac{\hbar}{N_q}$$
    \item This principle describes the \textbf{physical process} by which a small number of systems behave probabilistically while many systems stabilize and classicalize.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dimension Optimization Principle ($\pi$)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The effective dimension of spacetime is determined as an \textbf{optimal solution} that simultaneously satisfies the stability of causality and minimization of energy dissipation, arising from geometric necessity. This principle leads to the three-dimensional space we perceive.
    \item \textbf{Testable prediction}: Deviation of the effective dimension measured at minimal scales from three dimensions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critical Phase Transition Principle ($\hbar, \varphi$)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We maintain the primary model that \textbf{a phase transition from the quantum phase to the classical spacetime phase occurs when the effective degrees of freedom $N_q$ exceed a specific threshold $N_c$}.
    \item Here, the golden ratio $\varphi$ serves as a ``guarantor of non-resonance'' \textbf{ensuring that this phase transition avoids simple resonances or instabilities and forms robust and stable structures}. This is based on universal mathematical properties, as seen in many stable patterns in nature (e.g., Fibonacci sequence).
    \item \textbf{Safe positioning}: By positioning $\varphi$ not as a basis but as an \textbf{additional property} that \textbf{mathematically guarantees} \textbf{emergent stability}, we separate it from mystical interpretations and make it a subject of scientific discussion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications and Impact of the Theory}

\subsection{New Perspectives in Physics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spacetime as ``Emergent Order'' rather than ``Background''}: Redefines spacetime not as fixed, but as something generated from more fundamental statistical processes at the quantum level.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Necessity of Three-Dimensional Space}: Demonstrates that the specific dimension of three is statistically necessary as an optimal balance between information retention and stability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for Cosmological Challenges}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dark Energy}: The accelerating expansion of the universe may be naturally explained by the dynamic behavior of $N_q(t)$.
    \item \textbf{Dark Matter}: Opens a new path to explain its existence by interpreting it not as matter itself, but as spacetime distortions or local concentrations of effective degrees of freedom.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This represents a \textbf{more refined theory} with the potential to fundamentally transform existing physical views, similar to the achievements of Einstein and Schr√∂dinger.
