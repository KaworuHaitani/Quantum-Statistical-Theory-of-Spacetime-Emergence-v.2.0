abstract: "This theoretical framework proposes spacetime as an emergent phenomenon from quantum statistical processes rather than a given background. Built upon three fundamental bases (π, e, ℏ) representing geometry, statistics, and quantum granularity, the theory explains classical spacetime emergence through statistical scaling, dimension optimization, and phase transition principles, offering new insights into cosmological challenges."
