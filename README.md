# Quantum Statistical Theory of Spacetime Emergence V.2.0

This paper presents a theory of spacetime as emergent from quantum statistical processes. Based on fundamental constants (π, e, ℏ), it explains how classical spacetime emerges through statistical scaling and phase transitions, offering new insights on spatial dimensions and cosmological challenges.

## Abstract

This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding spacetime as an emergent phenomenon arising from quantum statistical processes, rather than as a given background. We propose three fundamental bases that underpin this emergence and outline the key principles governing the transition from quantum to classical spacetime.
